# Groovy Null Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to null handling in Groovy, specifically when a method explicitly returns null.  While seemingly innocuous, this can lead to unexpected null pointer exceptions in calling code.

## Bug Description

The `myMethod` function handles null input correctly.  However, returning `null` can cause issues if the caller doesn't explicitly check for null, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or `NullPointerExceptions`.  The issue is exacerbated by Groovy's dynamic typing where the return type of `null` can be implicitly cast into any type, leading to misleading outcomes.

## Solution

The solution involves improving null handling.  Consider explicitly handling null values or using a more informative return value, such as an empty collection or a dedicated null object.
